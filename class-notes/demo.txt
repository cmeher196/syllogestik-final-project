CSS - 3
    - inline : same styling we have to copy multiple places
    - internal :
        </body>
        <style>
        .paragraph{
            border: "2px solid red"
        }

//react
- it is js library UI
- developed by FB : 2015 
- components based library : everything in react is a components
- these components resembles with tag <App />
- two type of components in react : class / functional
- react 16.8.0 : introduced functional components
- lifecycle : doc got rendered, when the component got mount,will mount
- class component : lifecycle methods : componentWillMount(), componentDidMount(preState, currState), render()
- functional components : hooks
- hooks -> function : useState(): state management, useEffect(): lifecycle
        -> useMemo, useContext, useRedux


//Add js code to handle input and form submit event in your login and signup page.
//create a react app : counter app


//Agenda :
    - NO choice
    - Start Mobile Dev
    - ES6 and its functionalites
    - Package.json
    - package-lock.json
    - spread Operators
    - useEffects
    - module exports
    - module import
    - props

    - MObile Dev

---------------------------------------
Reacts : state management 
       : props
       : useEffects

ES6:
    - 2015 : 
    - defines rule and guideline for which complaint to js
    - variables:
        - let and const
    - Arrow function:
        - const sum = (a ,b) => a + b;
        - const isLoading = data => return false;
        - const App = () => return <h1>Hello team</h1>
    - Template Literals
        - "Hello how are you "+name1+ "How are you "+ name2+ ""
        - `Hello How are you ${name1} , How are you ${name}`
    - Class    
        - class Reactangle{
            constructor(w, h){
                this.w = w;
                this.h = h;
            }
            perimeter(){

            }
        }
    
    - Promises, (callback hell) 
    - async await
    - Module export and import
        - export default function App()
        - import App, {}
    
    - spread operator:
        - ...
        - array and Objects, string
        - let str = "hello";
            log(...str);

    


Day5:
    - npm
    - basic uses of package.json and package-lock.json
    - walk through the code (react native project)
    - handle or learn few new components
    - 9:28 am


NPM :
    - node package manager ?
    - npm stands for  node package manager.
    - Basically it is a default package manager for node.js and it allows us to install,
    - share, and manage libraries and packages for our projects.
    - 

Day6:
   - expo cli and react native cli 
   - components - > ActivityIndicator
                - > View
                - > Text
                - > Button
                - > TextInput

   - Assignments(single)
        - > Welcome page from Getting started + pending h/w : display 3rd section on clicking back
        - > Login and Sign Up page  (username, password, email)

        -> Sequence
            -> App lands on Getting Started page
            -> onClick on Getting Started button , user will goto signup page
            -> in Sign up user need to enter some details -> on signing up it should goto login page
            -> in Login page user should login with valid username-> on login it should land on welcome page.
            -> Welcome page there should be a button to log out which will take use to main Getting Started page

- Expo cli and react native cli
    - > cli ??
    - > command line interface (expo and react native)

    -> Expo cli :
        - developed after react native cli
        - workflow : managed the react native apps
                   : it removed all the complexity from a react native perpective 
                   : it take time to load the app
                   : no development
                   : to access expo based app you can use expo cmd using npx to create react native app
        - Features:
                   : So react Native cli doesnt give so many infra  features like camera, statusbar, etec
                   : which you expo provide : camera, notification, status bar, maps, and many more
        
        - Development :
                   : it allows us to run the application on local server
                   : it also allow us to run on virtual machine through local server
                   : Best way to develop POCs : sample apps
                   : it take cares to run app on difference screens like, simlutor, web abse, or through expo go App
                   : debugging is faster and visualization too

        - Deployment : 
                   : Using expo u can bundle up the package easily
                   : Then it helps to publish you app on local server or deployment server.

    -> React Native cli :
        - workflow : Bare workflow  -> it doesnt give you any thing, but large supportability  
        - customizations : in RN cli : u have to change code if needed .
        - Development : u need to have virtual machine 
                      : xcode/android studio (virtual machine)
                      : then you to setup cd to run on these VMs /simlutors 
                      : Full benefits of using native configurations: IOS / Android 
                      : Deployment : Xcode -> IOS / Andriod : to build package and run on server

--------------------------------------------------------xxxxxxxx--------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Mobile Dev:
    -> every day assignments
    -> around the logic or component which we will learn
    -> we will be building towards default e-commerce App project(! I will build) 
    -> u can make a grp(10) : project idea : share with us : usecase (optional)


Day7
    - props in react
    - FlatList
    - Custom Component : Card component
    - ActivityIndicator
    - Image
    - ImageBackground
      


Props:
    - Setting up relationship between Parent and Child component
    - Used to send properties from Parent to child to perform some action 
    - It is object notation 
    - We can send props through Component itself by passing a prop name 
    - We cam also pass some trigger action as well
    - Sample from parent
        - <Product title={data.title} price={data.price} discount={data.discount}



FlatList:
    - Powerful component of React Native
    - it used to render the data Lists in the component or page
    - it has its own properties like renderData, data, numSection, etec


//in react js
    const data =[{
        'id' : "1234"
        'name' :"Chandra"

    },
    {
        'id' : "1236"
        'name' :"Shruti"

    },
    {
        'id' : "1235"
        'name' :"Shubham"

    }
    
    ]

    {
        data.map(item =>{

            <Card key={item.key} title={item.name} />
        })
    }

- ActivityIndicator:
    - this component is a loader component
    - default shape is circular


-> Sequence
            (update your existing assignment with new concept learnt today)
            -> App lands on Getting Started page
            (below setup using different components, like Signup Component, Login, Component, Product Component, Card Component, etc)
            (Use props whereever is required)
            -> onClick on Getting Started button , user will goto signup page
            -> in Sign up user need to enter some details -> on signing up it should goto login page
            -> in Login page user should login with valid username-> on login it should land on welcome page.
            -> Welcome page there should be two buttons
                -> goto product page with list of products in card component
                -> log out which will take use to main Getting Started page
            - PS(welcome and product page should have User name on the top of the page)

DAY8

    - Image - done
    - ImageBackground -done
    - ScrollView - done

DAY9:
    - ActivityIndicator is optional
    - hooks(useState, useEffects, useContext, useRedux)    
    - Context and useContext(next session)
    - 

Assignment: 10 marks
    - create 2 buttons
        - one FlatList, ScrollView (array.map())
    - reuse card component to accomodate Images in card
    - passed it from main component and display
    - Also try to use all the new components learnt
        - show how FlatList used for scroll - done
        - Image
        - ImageBackground(sign up , login page, getting started page, welcome page)
        - ScrollView
        - SectionList - try out from products(like shoes, dress, etc)
        - SafeAreaView / View
        - Switch - changing background color
